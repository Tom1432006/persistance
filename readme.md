# Persistance

This Project is inspired by the video on the YouTube channel Numberphile about multiplicative persistance. [Link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wim9WJeDTHQ)

The script is writen in C++ and can be ran from the command line. You can calculate the multiplicative persistance of a number as well as the additive persistance of a number.

# Usage

The first argument after the program name is the number you want to calculate the persistance of. The rest of the arguments can follow in a random order and are optional.

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| -b | Shows a *breakdown* of all the steps of the calculation |
| -v | Stands for *version*. Requires a value. Either 0 (default) for multiplication and 1 for addition |
